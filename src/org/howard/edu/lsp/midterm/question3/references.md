## AI Assistant Interactions
Me:
How can I explain that the current Car class structure canâ€™t handle changing trim levels at runtime?
ChatGPT:
You could explain that inheritance in Java is fixed at compile time, so a Base car cannot become a Sports car dynamically. Also, creating a new object would break references and lose state.

Me:
Okay, and how do I describe using composition to allow dynamic trim changes?
ChatGPT:
Mention that you can make TrimLevel an interface and let Car hold a TrimLevel instance. This way, the trim can be updated at runtime while the Car object keeps its state. Highlight benefits like flexibility, object continuity, and adherence to the Open/Closed Principle.
