## Essay Question 1

# Part A: 
According to Riel's heuristics, a well-designed class should have a high cohesion. Meaning:
1. All methods and attributes within the class should be working together to provied a single and well-defined responsibility.
2. Each method should be using some part of the class attributes.
3. The class should represent a single logical concept or entity within the system.

High cohesion is preferable because it:
- Simplifies maintenance and debugging
- Reduces complexity
- Makes the class more reusable and flexible
- Follows the Single Responsibility Principle in OO design

# Part B:
The StudentPortalHelper class demonstrates low cohesion for the following resonings:
1. Multiple Unrelated responsibilities
- GPA calculation (academic logic)
- File I/O (data persistence)
- Email formatting (communication)
- UI formatting (presentation)
- Payment processing (financial)
- Security (password validation)
- Caching (infrastructure)

2. Violation of Riel's heuristics
- The class acts as a "god class" containing multiple functionalities that are Unrelated
- Methods don't share common attributes or state 
- Most methods are static, suggesting utility behavior instead of a meaningful object-oriented design

# Proposed Refactoring Approach 
The class should be split into several cohesive classes, each with a single responsibility:

```
org.howard.edu.lsp.studentPortal
├── academic/
│   └── GPACalculator.java
├── io/
│   └── RosterExporter.java
├── communication/
│   └── EmailFormatter.java
├── ui/
│   └── DateFormatter.java
├── payment/
│   └── TuitionProcessor.java
├── security/
│   └── PasswordValidator.java
└── infrastructure/
    └── CacheService.java
```

Each new class would focus on one specific aspect of the system, improving:
- Better Maintainability and Readibility
- Improved Testability
- Reusability
- Code organization

This refactoring aligns with both Riel's heuristics and the Single Responsibility Principle of SOLID design principles.
