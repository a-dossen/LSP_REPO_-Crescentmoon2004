## Prompt 1: Initial Design Brainstorming
"Help me redesign my ETL pipeline to be more object-oriented. I need to maintain the same functionality but make it more maintainable and follow OO principles."

**AI Response Excerpt:**
"We can break down the ETL pipeline into distinct classes with clear responsibilities:
1. Product class to encapsulate data and transformation logic
2. CSVReader for file input
3. CSVWriter for file output
4. Main ETLPipeline class to orchestrate the process"

## Prompt 2: Object-Oriented Structure
"How should I structure the Product class to properly encapsulate the data and transformations?"

**AI Response Excerpt:**
"The Product class should:
- Have private fields for all attributes
- Provide public getters for necessary access
- Encapsulate transformation logic within the class
- Include methods for each transformation step
- Provide a clean interface for the main pipeline"

## Prompt 3: Implementation Details
"What's the best way to handle error cases and maintain the same functionality while being more object-oriented?"

**AI Response Excerpt:**
"Each class should handle its own specific errors:
- CSVReader handles file reading and parsing errors
- Product handles data validation
- CSVWriter manages output file creation
- Main class orchestrates and provides user feedback
This maintains the same error handling while improving code organization."
